# Differences between Functions and Methods 

There are three key differences between function and a method: 

1. All methods of a class must be indented under the class statement; 
2. All methods have a special first parameter that (by convetion) is named self 
3. Methods in a class can use instance variables, written in the form self.<variableName>
